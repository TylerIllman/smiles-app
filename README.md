Smileys utilises a modern tech stack and infrastructure including: Next.js, Planetscale, Tailwind, React, Typescript, Prisma and TRPC.

### tRPC for Type Safety
Implementing tRPC, Smileys ensures robust type safety across its client-server communication. This choice greatly reduces the chances of bugs related to type mismatches, enhancing the overall stability of the application.

### Clerk for User Authentication
For user authentication, Smileys integrates Clerk. This not only streamlines the sign-in and registration processes but also fortifies the platformâ€™s security, safeguarding user information and access rights.

### Next.js and Planetscale for Performance and Scalability
The application is built using Next.js, offering a flexible and high-performance framework for the web frontend. Planetscale supports the backend with its scalable, serverless database platform, ensuring that Smileys remains responsive and efficient as its user base grows.

### Zod for Form Validation
Zod is employed to validate forms, an essential aspect to maintain the integrity of user input. It helps in preventing erroneous or malicious data entries, thus enhancing the reliability of the platform.

### Database Management with Prisma
Prisma is used for efficient database management. Its role as an ORM tool simplifies database queries and schema management. Prisma's auto-generated types are particularly beneficial, enhancing the appâ€™s type safety in harmony with tRPCâ€™s capabilities.
